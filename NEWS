  - Get the status of the deploying nodes by pressing the <ENTER> key
  - Use variables in custom PXE profiles (see doc sec/4.2.2, Use Case 6)
  - Create custom microsteps before, after or instead of an existing one
    (see doc sec/4.2.2, Use Case 10)
  - Deploy directly on a block device with a DD image of the entire disk
    (see doc sec/4.2.2, Use Case 11)
  - The demolishing_env field of environments descriptions is now a boolean
    (see doc sec/4.2.4, Environment description)
  - A lot of variables are now exported by Kadeploy when running scripts
    (see doc sec/4.5)

* New automata to handle deployments workflow:
  - Specify timeouts and retries on automata's microsteps (see doc sec/2.3.2)
  - Improved deployment process for DD images
  - Create custom microsteps before, after or instead of an existing one
    (see doc sec/2.3.2, Custom operations)
  - Kexec is now available at the first reboot (SetDeploymentEnv macro-step)
    (see doc sec/2.3.2, The automata macro-steps)

* Parallel commands execution:
  - New TakTuk wrapper
  - Execution of system commands
  - Improvement of performances
  - Better gathering of commands statuses and outputs

* Some other minor changes:
  - RC scripts are now saving launch time errors in the syslog

  - Unit test suite
  - A lot of bug fixes

!! Changes in configuration files !!
* Cluster specific configuration (doc sec/2.3)
  - The fields concerning the demolishing settings (threshold value, ...)
    have been removed, this functionality is no more supported
  - The fields 'retries' of each macro step description do now have the right
    behavior, it specifies the number of retries instead of the number of tries
* Clusters configuration file (doc sec/2.2)
  - For display purposes, a prefix can be associated to each cluster
* Changes in the partitioning maps (doc sec/2.4)
  - You can now specify parted maps (instead of parted scripts)
