  - The 'kernels' field has been moved to 'boot/kernels'
  - A specific PXE header can be specified for each kind of reboot
  - The string \n is no more replaced by a new line in PXE headers
    (use YAML notation for multi-line headers)
  - A list of supported filesystems have to be given for the deployment env.
* Clusters configuration file (doc sec/2.2)
  - The fields concerning the partition maps have been removed, this
    functionality is no more supported
* Changes in the partitioning maps (doc sec/2.4)
  - Partition maps are not needed anymore

* The demolishing_env field of environments descriptions is now a boolean
  (see doc sec/4.2.4, Environment description)
* A lot of variables are now exported by Kadeploy when running scripts
  (see doc sec/4.5)

== Internals ==
* New automata to handle deployments workflow:
  - Specify timeouts and retries on automata's microsteps (see doc sec/2.3.2)
  - Improved deployment process for DD images
  - Create custom microsteps before, after or instead of an existing one
    (see doc sec/2.3.2, Custom operations)
  - Kexec is now available at the first reboot (SetDeploymentEnv macro-step)
    (see doc sec/2.3.2, The automata macro-steps)
* Parallel commands execution:
  - New TakTuk wrapper
  - Execution of system commands
  - Better gathering of commands statuses and outputs
* Some other minor changes:
  - RC scripts are now saving launch time errors in the syslog
  - Doc: Creation of (new) deployment environments (see doc sec/2.6.2)
  - Doc: Do a custom partitioning (see doc sec/4.7)
  - Unit test suite
  - A lot of bug fixes

* Cluster specific configuration (doc sec/2.3)
  - The fields concerning the demolishing settings (threshold value, ...)
    have been removed, this functionality is no more supported
  - The fields 'retries' of each macro step description do now have the right
    behavior, it specifies the number of retries instead of the number of tries
* Clusters configuration file (doc sec/2.2)
  - For display purposes, a prefix can be associated to each cluster
* Changes in the partitioning maps (doc sec/2.4)
  - You can now specify parted maps (instead of parted scripts)
  - In your maps you can use several PARTTYPE<N> instead of a single one
* Pre/post install files:
