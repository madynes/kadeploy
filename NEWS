New in 3.1.6:
* CLI modifications:
  - The CLI display has been modified to look clearer
  - Create custom microsteps before, after or instead of an existing one [see doc#]
  - Get the status of the nodes involved in a deployment by pressing the <ENTER>
    key
  - Use custom PXE files with built-in prefixes [see doc#]

* New automata to handle deployments workflow:
  - Specify timeouts and retries on automata's microsteps [see doc#]
  - Create custom microsteps before, after or instead of an existing one
    (a custom microstep is a sequence of actions, the available actions are:
    send a file, run a script, execute a command) [see doc#]
  - Improved deployment process for DD images

* Deploy directly on a block device with a DD image of the entire disk [see doc#]

* Changes in the cluster specific configuration files:

    (threshold value, ...) have been removed, this functionality is no more
    supported
  - The fields "retries" of each macro step description do now have the right
    meaning: it specify the number of retries instead of the number of tries
    [see doc#]

* Changes in the clusters configuration file:
  - A prefix can be associated to each cluster, it will be use for display
    purposes [see doc#]

* Changes in the partitioning maps:
  - You can now specify parted maps (instead of parted scripts)
  - In your maps you can use several PARTTYPE<N> instead of a single one [see doc#]

* Documentation:

  - Use case: custom partitioning [see doc#]
